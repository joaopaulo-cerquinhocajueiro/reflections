- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on different computers or in groups. The remote serves to contralize the project.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

No reason to clutter the remote repository with experimenting or non-functional code.
