- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on different computers or in groups. The remote serves to centralize the project.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

No reason to clutter the remote repository with experimenting or non-functional code.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches are for test and variations of your own code (mostly). Clones are for
making local copies of remote repositories that will be mostly synchronized.
Forks are for different versions of a project on github - normally owned by
different people.

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

To resolve the conflicts and merge locally and keep the repository clean.
